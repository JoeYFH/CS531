# CS531 Class Homework Sharing Dashboard

A web-based platform for students to upload different solutions to the same problems and conduct code reviews.

## Features

- **Problem Management**: Add and view programming problems
- **Solution Upload**: Students can upload their solutions with descriptions
- **Code Review**: Compare different approaches and add review comments
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, C, and more
- **Solution Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of different solutions to the same problem

## How to Use

1. **View Problems**: Browse available programming problems
2. **Upload Solutions**: Submit your solution with code and description
3. **Review Code**: Compare different approaches and provide feedback
4. **Learn**: Study different implementation strategies from classmates

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Start by viewing existing problems or adding new ones
3. Upload your solutions with clear descriptions
4. Use the review section to compare and discuss different approaches

## Contributing

1. Add problems via the "Add New Problem" button
2. Upload solutions with clear descriptions and comments
3. Provide constructive feedback during code reviews
4. Help improve the platform by suggesting enhancements

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Client-side storage (localStorage) for demo purposes
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **No Backend Required**: Can run entirely in the browser

## Sample Problems Included

1. **Two Sum**: Find indices of two numbers that add up to target
2. **Reverse String**: Reverse a string using different approaches
3. **Palindrome Check**: Check if a string reads the same forwards and backwards

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, consider:
- **Correctness**: Does the solution work for all test cases?
- **Efficiency**: What's the time and space complexity?
- **Readability**: Is the code well-structured and documented?
- **Style**: Does it follow language conventions?
- **Approach**: Are there alternative or more elegant solutions?

## Future Enhancements

- Backend integration for persistent storage
- User authentication and profiles
- Automated testing integration
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Discussion threads for each solution
